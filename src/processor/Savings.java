/**
 This class is a subclass of the Account class, thus extending all of its methods and applies conditions specific to a
 Savings account. It has a constructor based off of a Profile object, Account balance, and a loyalCustomerCode which
 denotes whether a customer is loyal or not. Along with this it has monthlyInterest, fee, and getType methods defined
 with proper values in respect to the guidelines of a Savings account. Also, there is a toString method which returns
 information about the Savings account as a string.
