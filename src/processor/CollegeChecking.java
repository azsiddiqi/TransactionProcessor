/**
 This class is a subclass of the Checking class, thus extending all of its methods and applies conditions specific to a
 CollegeChecking account. It has a constructor based off of a Profile object, account balance, and a campus code. Along
 with this it has monthlyInterest, fee, and getType methods defined with proper values in respect to the guidelines of a
 college checking account. Also, there is a toString method which returns information about the CollegeChecking account
 as a string.
