/**
 This class creates an Account object based off of a Profile object and a double denoting the balance of an account.
 It also has an equals method to check to see if two accounts are the same and a toString method which returns the type
 of the account, the account holder, and the balance of the account. Along with this there are three abstract methods
 which extend to the Account class's subclasses that return the monthly interest, the monthly fee, and the type of the
 account.
